# Advanced Node.js Quantum Computing and Quantum Internet

This project is an advanced implementation of Quantum Computing and Quantum Internet using Node.js. It uses the OpenAI API for Quantum computations and communications.

## Project Structure

- `package.json` - Contains the metadata of the project and its dependencies.
- `.env` - Contains environment variables. You need to set your OpenAI API key here.
- `app.js` - The main entry point of the application.
- `quantumComputing.js` - Module for Quantum Computing.
- `quantumInternet.js` - Module for Quantum Internet.
- `README.md` - This file, containing information and instructions about the project.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-nodejs-quantum-computing-and-internet.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd advanced-nodejs-quantum-computing-and-internet
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key" > .env
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the application and initialize the Quantum Computing and Quantum Internet modules.
